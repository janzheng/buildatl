Glad to see you're enjoying the Abusing Axure series.

Axure can be used from the most basic layout designs to very complex (probably overly complex and over-designed) prototypes. That's what makes Axure fun. This series explores the various ways one could over-engineer Axure.

Axure was not designed with Media Queries and responsive design in mind. Whereas parallax is probably a passing web-design fad, responsive design will probably stay for a while longer. Here is one way to explore how to simulate responsive web design using a very simple Axure technique.
