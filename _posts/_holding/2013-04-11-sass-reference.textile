Hello new blog, and hello Textile!

Having only written in Markdown and pure HTML, I've decided to pick up Textile. Seems like Textile's a little more flexible and supports things like inline CSS classes and IDs - those could come in handy. With that said, I've never written in textile before. Since  this is my first post, this is going to be a sort of textile review / cheat sheet / practice ground to help me get started.


bc. 
$(function(){
   $(".post-home h1 a").hover(
     function () {
       $(this).parent().parent().find(".external").addClass("hover");
     },
     function () {
       $(this).parent().parent().find(".external").removeClass("hover");
     }
   );
});

hmmm
