- Why are these universally bad?
- Has anyone driven a Ford with a myTouch? We rented a car with it, and it crashed during driving, and had to restart itself
- Design for touch, low resolution

Good: many different features, programmable, apps, high tech
Bad: Have to look down / no tactile, hard to remember where things are / confusing, confusing interfaces / inconsistent design; NOT SIMPLE to use / information overload (...while driving)

- 1. Screenshots of the myTouch
- 2. Design your own
