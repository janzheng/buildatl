- Wireframes should reflect website behavior as closely as possible
- Easier client buyoff
- Better representation of the real world
- Case for presenting wireframes in their different environment
- show how different devices and interfaces show off intent; show how intent shines through
- Websites should NOT be Mobile first- they should be Intent first and Content second
- Delivery method for content, information, and action
- Responsive Wireframes can easier show how this intent is meant to be delivered
- Will help the design / creative team formulate their design concepts
- Will work with the design team / empower and inform the design team to create something strong, more useful
