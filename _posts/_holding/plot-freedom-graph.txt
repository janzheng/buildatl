The endings and paths within the game may have a set of predetermined options, but the choices and paths through the game will vary depending on what you do. I would argue that this is how games should be designed: games are an interactive medium, and that interaction should not merely be incidental to the experience, but essential to it.

This interactivity separates games from books and movies. That's why, despite the new challenges of balancing story progression, player agency, and interaction, games truly need to respect their own medium to achieve full success. BioShock: Infinite, though still a compelling experience, failed to find that balance.
