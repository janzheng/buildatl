
(UX) Project Delivery Process 
--------------------------------

The entire delivery process is made up of several iterations called Milestones. Each Milestone consists of a smaller cycle, and each Milestone has core deliverables before it could be considered reached.

Sometimes a group of Milestones could be iterated upon, each of these iterations is considered a Round, and the deliverables from that iteration is a Revision on that Milestone's deliverables.

Each Milestone consists of the same basic cycle:
1. Understand
2. Generate
3. Validate

The idea is that to accomplish each Milestone (and the project as a whole)
1. we have to establish requirements (what are we creating?), 
2. go through the creation process of creating each deliverable (let's create!), 
3. then validate what has been created (did we create the right thing?). 

Some projects might require more iterations and revisions, and some will require different groups of tasks. Note that roles and people (usually called 'resources') are never specified. However, each cycle needs to be validated by key stakeholders of the projects. Each Stakeholder will need to sign off on each revision of a Milestone.




Milestones
--------------------------------

Stakeholders
- Client / Stakeholder (Account)
- Project Management
- Technical
- User Experience
- Visual

- Each milestone needs one Stakeholder as a 'champion' 




UNDERSTAND PHASE 
------------------------------------------
A. Establish Project Core Experience Needs & Requirements
	1a. Understand client / stakeholder needs & requirements
	1b. Understand user needs and behavior
	2.  Genrate Deliverable
	3. 	Validate by confirming with clients, research, and with internal team
	
	Deliverable: Project Needs & Requirement documentation
	
	A1. Stakeholder Research
	A2. User Research

B. Establish Project Timelines & Budget


- At the end of this phase, we've understood the scope, requirements, needs, and timeline / budget of the project



PREPARATION PHASE
------------------------------------------
A. Establish Creative Needs & Requirements
	1. Understand client / stakeholder creative needs & requirements
	2. Generate Deliverable
	3. Validate by confirming with clients and internal team
	
	Deliverable: Creative deliverables that visually establish the core creative idea


B. Establish User Experience Needs & Requirements

C. Establish Technical Requirements


PROTOTYPE / Testing PHASE
------------------------------------------


GENERATION PHASE
------------------------------------------
A. Generate Design

B. Generate UX

C. Generate Code
