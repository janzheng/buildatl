Hello new blog, and hello Textile!

Having only written in Markdown and pure HTML, I've decided to pick up Textile. Seems like Textile's a little more flexible and supports things like inline CSS classes and IDs - those could come in handy. With that said, I've never written in textile before. Since  this is my first post, this is going to be a sort of textile review / cheat sheet / practice ground to help me get started.

Even Mr. Sedaris, a noted luddite, has finally succumbed to doing his writing on a computer.  The Internet, however, remains an idiotic trifle:

bq. I've never seen the Internet. I don't have email. I just enjoy lying on the couch and reading a magazine. When people say, "You should visit my Web page," I'm always perplexed by it. Why? What do you do there?

Haven't we all pondered that at one time or another?
